# Graph Cycle Detector

A C program to find and analyze cycles (n-gons, n > 2) in weighted, undirected graphs. Uses DFS on an adjacency list graph to detect simple cycles, calculate perimeters (sum of edge weights), and report frequency by size.

## Features

- Graph representation (adjacency lists).
- Cycle detection (DFS).
- Perimeter calculation.
- Shape frequency reporting.
- Reads graph data from a file.
